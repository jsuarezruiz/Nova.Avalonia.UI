## Controls

### Avatar

The `Avatar` control presents a person's identity using an image, initials, icon, or custom content. It includes automatic background generation, size presets, and optional presence status indicators.

### Shimmer

The `Shimmer` control shows a lightweight skeleton while your content is loading. It inspects the visual tree beneath it to draw shapes that match controls, then animates a gradient sweep over the placeholders.
