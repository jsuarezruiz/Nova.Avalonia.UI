# Welcome to Nova.Avalonia.UI

**Nova.Avalonia.UI** is a comprehensive suite of controls for [Avalonia UI](https://avaloniaui.net/). The library bridges the gap between standard framework controls and the complex requirements of modern applications, providing components that are production-ready, fully themeable, and accessibility-first.


## Overview

### Controls

- **[Avatar](docs/controls/avatar.md)**: Identity control supporting images, initials, icons, and status indicators with auto-generated backgrounds.
- **[Badge](docs/controls/badge.md)**: Notification indicator for counts, status, or dot indicators with configurable placement and overflow handling.
- **[BarcodeGenerator](docs/controls/barcodegenerator.md)**: Generates QR codes, Data Matrix, Code 128, and other barcode formats with customizable colors and logo support.
- **[RatingControl](docs/controls/ratingcontrol.md)**: Allows users to view and set ratings using interactive items such as stars, hearts, or custom shapes.
- **[Shimmer](docs/controls/shimmer.md)**: Skeleton loading effect that detects your content layout to create matching placeholders.

### Panels

- **[ArcPanel](docs/controls/arcpanel.md)**: Arranges items along an arc (partial circle) for semi-circular menus or dial interfaces.
- **[AutoLayout](docs/controls/autolayout.md)**: A layout panel inspired by Figma's Auto Layout with Orientation, Spacing, Padding, and Alignment.
- **[AvatarGroup](docs/controls/avatargroup.md)**: Layout container for stacking multiple avatars with configurable overlap and overflow handling.
- **[AvatarStackPanel](docs/controls/avatarstackpanel.md)**: A specialized panel for laying out avatars with overlap.
- **[BubblePanel](docs/controls/bubblepanel.md)**: Packs circular items using a circle packing algorithm for dense, organic layouts.
- **[CircularPanel](docs/controls/circularpanel.md)**: Arranges items evenly around a circle, perfect for radial menus or clock faces.
- **[HexPanel](docs/controls/hexpanel.md)**: Layout panel that arranges items in a honeycomb hexagonal grid.
- **[LoopPanel](docs/controls/looppanel.md)**: Infinite scrolling panel with looping, inertia, and snap-to-item behavior.
- **[OrbitPanel](docs/controls/orbitpanel.md)**: Arranges child elements in concentric orbit rings around a center point.
- **[OverlapPanel](docs/controls/overlappanel.md)**: Stacks children with configurable X/Y offsets for card pile effects.
- **[RadialPanel](docs/controls/radialpanel.md)**: Arranges items in a circular or spiral fan arrangement.
- **[ResponsivePanel](docs/controls/responsivepanel.md)**: Adaptive panel that toggles visibility of children based on breakpoints.
- **[StaggeredPanel](docs/controls/staggeredpanel.md)**: Positions items in a staggered grid, creating a masonry-like effect.
- **[TimelinePanel](docs/controls/timelinepanel.md)**: Arranges items in a timeline/step flow with connecting lines.
- **[VariableSizeWrapPanel](docs/controls/variablesizewrappanel.md)**: Arranges varying-sized items in a wrapping grid.
- **[VirtualizingStaggeredPanel](docs/controls/staggeredpanel.md)**: High-performance staggered grid for large datasets.
- **[VirtualizingVariableSizeWrapPanel](docs/controls/variablesizewrappanel.md)**: High-performance variable-size tile grid for large datasets.
